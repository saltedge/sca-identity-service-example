## What is Identity Service?
  
[Identity Service WIKI](https://github.com/saltedge/sca-identity-service-example/wiki)  
  
The purpose of Identity Service is to process and store customer identities, roles, credentials, and add the necessary functionality in order to implement SCA. Hence, besides standard functionality, in Identity Service should be implemented additional functionalities and an API, as an extension to the existing Identity Service. The extension (additional functionality and API) processes received from Core banking information and appeals to the Authenticator app via Authentication Service in order to get either action confirmation or denial from the customer.

There is a little effort from Service Provider in order to implement the extension of Identity Service with 6 API end-points: 
* Create Connection between Client App and Service; 
* Revoke Access Token; 
* Show Pending Authorizations List; 
* Show Single Pending Authorization; 
* Confirm or Deny Pending Authorization.  
and add authentication/enrollment flow for `Obtaining Access Token`
  
Salt Edge has developed the SCA solution with such an architecture, having Identity Service in infrastructure of Service Provider, in order not to have any access to the personal information/credentials of the customer. All related to the customer private data is isolated from any third party or application and is controlled exclusively by the Service Provider.

Besides public API, may be implemented next useful end-points for internal usage (non-public):
* Revoke connection. For some reasons (security reason, cleaning job, etc.) Bank (Service Provider) should have possibility to revoke any connection
* Create new authorization. Identity service should create new authorization with data from request from Core banking (`authorization_code`, `title`, `description`, `user_id`), and send notifications (through Push Service) about new authorization to related connections.

## Identity Service Models

![schema](images/authenticator_models_schema.png)

### User model
`User` represents an abstract single customer of Bank's Identity Service (e.g  Service Provider). This entity is already present in Bank's Identity Service.

### Connection (Mobile Client) model
`Mobile Client` represents a single connection between `User` and  Mobile Application. Each `User` can have multiple `Mobile Client`'s because user can have many connections to a single Service Provider from different applications.
  
- `id` - a unique ID string
- `user_id` - ID of related user model
- `public_key` - a unique Asymmetric Public Key in PEM format string
- `push_token` - a unique token string which uniquely identifies Mobile Application for the Push Notification system (i.e. unique address of current Mobile Application instance)
- `access_token` - a unique token string for authenticated access to API resources
- `return_url` - a URL the Mobile Application will be redirected to at the end of the authentication process
- `connect_session_token` - a unique token string for authentication session process
- `revoked` - a boolean value which indicates that connection is active or revoked
- `created_at` - a datetime
- `updated_at` - a datetime

### Authorization model
`Authorization` represents a single action for user. Each `User` can have multiple `Authorization`'s.
  
- `id` - a unique ID string
- `user_id` - ID of related user model
- `expires_at` - a datetime which indicates period of validity of authorization action
- `title` - title of authorization action
- `description` - description of authorization action
- `authorization_code` - generated unique code per each authorization action based on set of input information (datetime, amount, payee, account, etc.)
- `confirmed` - a boolean value which indicates that Authorization was confirmed or denied
- `created_at` - a datetime
- `updated_at` - a datetime


### Log model
- `id` - a unique ID string
- `message` - logged message as JSON
- `signature` - signed message 
- `public_key` - a unique Asymmetric Public Key in PEM format string
- `created_at` - a datetime

### Push Server Configuration
 - `push_server_url` - a URL of Push Server
 - `push_server_app_id` - a unique token string, released by Push Server owner
 - `push_server_app_secret` - a unique token string, released by Push Server owner

***Optional***, if Push Service is implemented inside Identity Service.

## Service Configuration

Authenticator application can has hardcoded service configuration (e.g. service url) or support dynamic configuration.  

For dynamic confoguration we propose to use application links (deep-links) or encoded in QR code image application links.
For initiating connect flow, service should generate application link for initiating connection in mobile application. 
Example of application link:  
``` 
  authenticator://saltedge.com/connect?configuration=https://saltedge.com/configuration
```  

Application link can contains extra authentication data (`connect_query` param). This connect flow is named "Instant Enrollment".  
Additional authentication parameter should be sent to service while [connecting to provider](#connect-to-service-provider).  
Example of application link with exta data:  
``` 
  authenticator://saltedge.com/connect?configuration=https://saltedge.com/configuration&connect_query=A12345678
```  

More information on "Instant Enrollment" can be found [here](https://github.com/saltedge/sca-identity-service-example/wiki/Value-added-features#instant-enrollment).

## API Security
The following section describes the different security approaches used for securing data flow.

- All sensitive data should be encrypted (e.g. 2048-bit keys).
- All communications should be performed over HTTPS channel with certificate issued by CA (self-signed certificates not allowed).
- All requests from clients should be signed (if possible). 
- The private key should be securely stored on client side. In case of possible security breach, the private key should be regenerated and the public key should be updated.

**Before all, service client should provide public key (Mobile Application to Identity Service or Identity Service to Push Service).**

### Signature Headers
The following headers are required for your request to be considered signed:
-   `Expires-at` - request expiration time as a UNIX time (seconds since Jan 01 1970) in UTC timezone. We suggest to use +1 minute from the current time. The maximum value is 1 hour from now in UTC, otherwise  `SignatureExpired` error will be raised;
-   `Signature`  -  `base64`  encoded  `SHA256`  signature of the string represented in the form  
`request_method|original_url|Expires-at|post_body`  
4 parameters concatenated with a vertical bar  `|`, signed with the clientâ€™s private key.

Example:
```
  Expires-at: "1570032760"
  Signature: "0H6xaZ8g67....H8="
```  
 
The fields  `request_method`, `original_url` and `post_body` from the `Signature` header represent:  
- `request_method` - lowercase method name of the HTTP request. Example: `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, etc.;
- `original_url`   - the full requested URL, with all its complementary parameters;
- `Expires-at`     - request expiration time as a UNIX time (seconds since Jan 01 1970) in UTC timezone, should be equal to `Expires-at` header parameter;
- `post_body`      - the request post body. Should be left empty if it is a GET request, or the body is empty;  
  
**Note:**  
**_Signature field on mobile app is being created with body which is equal to raw string of request payload.
As we know, sometimes in Web App Controller is received already parsed object. You must use raw string of request payload because signature generation/veification is very sensitive to `post_body` string._**

## API Errors
During any request on Salt Edge SCA Service side, a number of errors may appear. In order to standardize errors while still giving some degree of freedom in explaining an error callback, parameters should include both `error_class` and `error_message`. Error message serves the purpose of communicating the issue to the Client, whereas error class should be used by client application in order to be able to handle various scenarios.

Contents of the `error_message` are entirely up to the Salt Edge SCA Service, they may even be localized. However, values sent within `error_class` parameter should be from the standardized list. This list may and will be extended over time.
  
### Bad Request errors (code: 400):  
* `WrongRequestFormat` - some of request params are not valid;
* `AccessTokenMissing` - `access_token` header is missing;
* `SignatureMissing` - `signature` header is missing;
* `SignatureExpired` - `expires_at` header is missing or `expires_at` is before now;
* `InvalidSignature` - `signature` param is invalid;
* `ActionExpired` - Action entity is expired.
  
### Unauthorized errors (code: 401):  
* `ConnectionNotFound` - connection associated with by `access_token` header not found or it is invalid;  
* `UserNotFound` - connection associated with Connection not found.  
  
### Not Found errors (code: 404):  
* `AuthorizationNotFound` - authorization queried by `authorization_id` param not found;  
* `ActionNotFound` - action queried by `action_id` param not found.

## Identity Service API

### API data types
The following section describes the different data types used for request and response data.

[JSON format](https://restfulapi.net/json-data-types/) is used for request/response data formatting. Since all data is eventually represented as UTF-8 strings, these types mostly define what characters are considered valid for data of a specific type. Additional validation rules may apply for specific parameters.  
Several primitive types:
**Boolean** - A case insensitive Boolean value, represented as either `true` or `false`.

**Integer** - An integer number. For example: `123`

**String** - A string of characters. For example: `"any string"`

**TimeStamp** - The time and date represented in ISO 8601 format (e.g. `2017-04-19T13:53:31Z`). The time and date must always be represented in the GMT time zone, even if the server or client uses a different default time zone.

**Array** - An array of values. Arrays are encoded by adding brackets.  For example: `"data": ["1", "2", "3"]`

**Object/Hashmap/Dictionary** - An associative array of values. For example: `"data": { id: "1", connection_id: "333" }`

### Headers

There are several common points about the request we send:
- The `Content-Type` header is  `application/json`;
- There is a `Signature` header that identifies the request was signed;
- There is a `Expires-at` header that identifies expiration time of the request;
- The JSON object sent will always have a  `data` field;

---

### User-Agent Header
The User-Agent request header is a characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent.

Example:
```
Application name; version name/code; installer name; phone manufacturer; model; SDK version
```

### Instant Action

`Action` is an entity, with the purpose of fast and password free customer authentication.
Initialization of the `Instant Action` procedure starts with generating a QR code, which contains an encoded deep link.
Deep link contains unique ID of the newly generated `Action` entity, base url of the Identity Service by which application finds the related `Connection` for future request signing and `return_to` url for redirecting back from Salt Edge Authenticator to Action initiator application (`return_to` is optional).
After what `Action` is sent to Identity Service, service provider should perform related `Action` procedure (e.g. sign-in).

For more information please read [Instant Action WIKI](https://github.com/saltedge/sca-identity-service-example/wiki/Value-added-features#instant-action)

#### Action Deep Link Example:

`authenticator://saltedge.com/action?action_uuid=123456&connect_url=http://someurl.com&return_to=http://return.com`

#### Action Deep Link Parameters:

- `action_uuid` **[string, required]** - an unique identifier of the action
- `connect_url` **[string, required]** - base url of the Identity Service's Connection
- `return_to` **[string, optional]** - an url, which is used for redirect

#### Perform Action:

`PUT` `/api/authenticator/v1/action/:uuid`

```bash
curl \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Access-Token: replace_with_your_token' \
  -H 'Expires-at: expires_at_time' \
  -H 'Signature: generated_signature' \
  -H 'User-Agent: device_info' \
  -X PUT \
  https://connector.service_host.com/api/authenticator/v1/actions/uuid123456
```

#### Request Path Parameters:

`uuid` - The uuid of the action, received from the `deeplink`

#### Request Headers:
- `Accept-Language` **[string, optional]** - preferred by client application locale variant. By default en;
- `Access-Token` **[string, required]** - access token, required to access resources which require authentication;
- `Expires-at` **[datetime, required]** - expiration time of request as a UNIX time (seconds since Jan 01 1970) in UTC timezone, required to access resources which verify request signature;
- `Signature` **[string, required]** - signed by Asymmetric Key string, required to access resources which verify request signature;
- `User-Agent` **[string, required]** - request header is a characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent.

#### Response Body Parameters:

- `success` **[boolean, required]** - result of the operation
- `connection_id` **[string, optional]** - an unique ID of Mobile Client (Service Connection)

## Authorization code builder example

If authorization code is generating as sha256, than resulting string should be Base64 encoded without paddings.
  
Ruby example:
```ruby
template = "#{payee_details}|#{amount}|#{time}|#{user_id}|#{description}|#{salt}"
authorization_code = Base64.urlsafe_encode64(Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(template), padding: false)
```

Java (JDK 8) example:
```java
    String template = payment.accountId.toString() + "|" + payment.amount + "|" + payment.getCreatedAt().toString() + 
        "|" + payment.user.id.toString() + " | " + payment.description + "|" + SALT;
    byte[] hashBytes = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256").digest(template.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    return Base64.getEncoder().withoutPadding().encodeToString(hashBytes);
```
