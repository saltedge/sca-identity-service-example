# Salt Edge Authenticator SCA Service Example & SDK (based on Spring Boot)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a full-stack application built on Spring Boot, 
designated to demonstrate SCA flow and communication between Service Provider and Salt Edge Authenticator Application. 
Current application implements Salt Edge Authenticator v1 API.  

Consists of modules:
* **SCA Service SDK v1**
* **Example Application**

## Application Requirements

1. JDK, at least version 8 
1. Spring Boot Framework, at least version 2.2.+
1. Registration & API Keys. Contact the Salt Edge Authenticator team via the [following link](https://www.saltedge.com/pages/contact_support)   
1. Authenticator Mobile clients supports only SSL connections.

## Example Application Quick Setup and Run
  
1. Clone project
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:saltedge/sca-identity-service-example.git
    ```
1. Navigate to project's root folder
    ```bash
    cd sca-identity-service-example/saltedge-sca-service-spring
    ```
1. Create configuration files
    ```bash
    cp example/src/main/resources/application.example.properties example/src/main/resources/application.properties
    ```  
1. Edit configuration files (`application.properties`)  
    * Example application uses a H2 in memory database (for now), can be changed easily for any other database type.
    * Set external host name for application
      ```yaml
      app.url=http://123456789.ngrok.io
      ```
    * Set external host name for SCA Service (can be equal to host name for application) 
      ```yaml
      sca_service.url=http://123456789.ngrok.io
      ```
    * Set params for Salt Edge Push service. Ask credentials from Salt Edge Service [**optional**].
      ```yaml
      sca_push_service.url=https://push.service.com/notification
      sca_push_service.app_id=xxxxxxxxx
      sca_push_service.app_secret=yyyyyyyyyyy
      ``` 
1. Run the Example Application
    ```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```  
      
## How to use example
  
  Example Application implements custom admin page for creating users, authorizing, creating connections, creating authorizations. Open in browser: `http://your_host:8080/`.  
  
  
## SDK Integration

1. Add SDK to target application as Module or as JAR library (`out/saltedge-sca-service-sdk-1.0.1-all.jar`);
1. Setup application as [described before](#example-application-quick-setup)  
  (add configuration)
1. Add SDK package (`com.saltedge.sca.sdk`) to component scan annotation in Application class.
    ```java
    @SpringBootApplication(scanBasePackages = {EXAMPLE_PACKAGE, SDK_PACKAGE})
    @EnableJpaRepositories(basePackages = {EXAMPLE_PACKAGE, SDK_PACKAGE})
    @EntityScan(basePackages = {EXAMPLE_PACKAGE, SDK_PACKAGE})
    public class ExampleApplication {
       public static final String SDK_PACKAGE = "com.saltedge.sca.sdk";
       
    }
    ```
1. Create a service which will provide info required by SCA SDK Module (Service should implement `ServiceProvider` interface and should have `@Service` annotation):  
    * `getAuthorizationPageUrl(String enrollSessionSecret)` - Provides URL of authentication page of Service Provider for redirection in Authenticator app. `enrollSessionSecret` is created by SDK;  
    (**Ignore if REDIRECT authentication is not supported**)  
    * `getUserIdByAuthenticationSessionSecret(String sessionSecret)` - Find User entity by authentication session secret code. `sessionSecret` is created by Service Provider and should be created when user already authenticated and need to connect Authenticator App (SDK);  
    * `getProviderCode()` - Provides code name of Service Provider (e.g demo-bank-code);  
    * `getProviderName()` - Provides human readable name of Service Provider (e.g. Demo Bank). Will be displayed for end customers;  
    * `getProviderLogoUrl()` - Provides logo image of Service Provider. Will be displayed for end customers;  
    * `getProviderSupportEmail()` - Provides email of Service Provider for clients support. Will be displayed for end customers;  
    * `onAuthorizationConfirmed(Authorization authorization)` - Notifies application about confirmation or denying of SCA Authorization;  
    * `onAuthenticateAction(AuthenticateAction action)` - Notifies application about receiving new authenticated Action request. It can be Sign-in to portal action or Payment action which requires authentication;  
    (**Ignore if Instant Action flow is not supported**)   
    
1. Use service `ScaSdkService` for backward communication between Application and SCA SDK Module. Using of service functions is not mandatory and depends on implemented features (Enrollment, Instant Enrollment, Authorization and Instant Action)
    
    Connections management:   
    * `createConnectAppLink()` - returns App-Link (deep-link) for initiating Enrollment flow in the Authenticator application.    
    (**Ignore if mobile client not supports enrollment initiated by App-Link**);  
    * `createConnectAppLink(authSessionSecret)` - returns App-Link (deep-link) with `authSessionSecret` for initiating Instant Enrollment flow in the Salt Edge Authenticator application;  
    (**Ignore if mobile client not supports enrollment initiated by App-Link**);  
    * `getClientConnections(userId)` - returns all Connections to Authenticators for User. Can be used for further Connections management by Service Provider (e.g. revoking);  
    * `revokeConnection(connectionId)` - invoke for revoking of Authenticator Connection. After that Authenticator will not receive pending Authorizations;  
    * `onUserAuthenticationSuccess(enrollSessionSecret, userId)` - should be invoked when REDIRECT authentication flow ends successfully and user should be redirected back to Authenticator app. Returns `ReturnTo Url` with `accessToken`. Where  `enrollSessionSecret` is unique code of enrollment session provided by `ServiceProvider.getAuthorizationPageUrl()`;  
    * `onUserAuthenticationFail(enrollSessionSecret, errorMessage)` - should be invoked when REDIRECT authentication failed and user should be redirected back to Authenticator app. Return `ReturnTo Url` with error;  
    
    Authorizations management:  
    * `createAuthorization(userId, confirmationCode, title, description)` - create new Authorization for user with required title, description and confirmationCode, and send push notification about new pending Authorization;  
    * `getAllAuthorizations(userId)` - returns all Authorizations for user;  
    * `getAuthorizationById(authorizationId)` - returns Authorization by ID;    
    
    Instant Actions management (**ignore if Instant Action flow is not supported**):  
    * `createAction(code)` - creates an Action entity with required code;  
    * `createActionAppLink(actionUUID)` - return App-Link (deep-link) for initiating Instant Action authentication flow in the Salt Edge Authenticator application;  
    * `getActionByUUID(actionUUID)` - returns Action by `actionUUID`;  
    * `getActionStatus(actionUUID)` - returns Action's status by `actionUUID`;
